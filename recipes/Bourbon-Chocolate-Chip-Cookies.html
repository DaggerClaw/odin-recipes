    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>If there was only <strong><em>ONE</em></strong> cookie that I could have for the rest of my life, it would be this cookie.</p>
        <p>The rich dark chocolate pairs with the sweet of the creamy peanut butter. The salty bacon pairs well with the rich vanilla notes of the bourbon making it one well <strong>rounded</strong> cookie.</p>
        <p>These cookies are the perfect desert to have with our <a href="./Pancetta-Pea-Pasta" alt="Pancetta Pea Pasta">Bucatini Con Piselli</a> and <a href="./focaccia-bread.html" alt="Garlic Focaccia Bread">Focaccia Bread</a></p>

    <h3>How You Make Them:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees farenheight. Line two 9x13-inch baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking soda,baking powder,and salt. Mix together with a fork until well blended</li>
            <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp, <em>(about 3 to 4 minutes each side)</em>, Let the bacon cool and drain. Reserve about 2 tbsp of bacon grease and set aside</li>
            <li>Combine the butter and bacon grease in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on medium speed utnil smooth <em>(about 1 minute).</em></li>
            <li>Beat in the melted peanut butter until well blended, <em>(about 1 minute)</em></li>
            <li>Beat in the sugars until creamy, <em>(about 3 minutes),</em>then add the egg and bourbon and beat until light and fluffy, <em>(about 3 more minutes)</em></li>

            <li>Using a scoop or your hands form 1 inch balls of the cookie dough, arrange them about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets</li>
            <li>Bake for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges crisp and the tops look golden brown but aren't quite set</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set the baking sheets on wire racks to cool for about 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to the racks to cool for about 10 more minutes</li>
