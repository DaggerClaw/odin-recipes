        <p>This recipe takes just 3 extra ingredients to turn it from child like to <strong><em>adulthood</em></strong> (we're not counting garlic or onions because those should be in every savory recipe you're making, even if they're just in powdered form).Pair this pasta with our <a href="./focaccia-bread.html" alt="focaccia bread">Delicious Garlic Herb Focaccia Bread</a> and finish the meal off with our <a href="./Bourbon-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies.html" alt="Bourbon Chocolate Chip Cookies">Bourbon Peanut Butter Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>!</p>
        <p>I know you must be wondering what exactly <strong><em>is</em></strong> bucatini. Think of it as the love child of Spaghetti and macaroni, if spaghetti was the husband. It's a long thin noodle that without looking closely could pass as spaghetti, however upon closer inspeciton has a hollow inside perfect to soke up creamy sauce.</p>
